/**
 * The MAIC slide object model — the canonical, dependency-free contract.
 *
 * This file is the single source of truth that supersedes the three copies that
 * had drifted apart before @maic/dsl existed:
 *   - app:      lib/types/slides.ts
 *   - renderer: packages/@maic/renderer/src/types/slides.ts
 *   - importer: packages/@maic/importer/src/openmaic/types/slides.ts
 *
 * It is a *superset*: every field that appeared in any of the three copies is
 * kept here so that the renderer and the importer can adopt this contract
 * without losing data. Fields that only existed in one copy are annotated with
 * `@since-merge` so the reconciliation history stays explicit. See README.md
 * (the "Divergence reconciled" section) for the full list.
 *
 * Pure types only — no runtime imports, no React/pptx/echarts.
 */
/**
 * Regular (not `const`) enum on purpose: consumers compile with
 * `isolatedModules`, under which importing an ambient `const enum` across the
 * package boundary is an error (TS2748). A regular enum emits a runtime object
 * that bundles cleanly and is usable as both a value and a type.
